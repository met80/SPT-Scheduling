Efficient task scheduling is essential in various fields such as manufacturing, computing, and project management to optimize workflows, minimize completion times, and enhance overall productivity. This project implements the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) algorithm using MATLAB, a classic scheduling strategy that prioritizes tasks based on their processing durations. By always selecting the task with the shortest processing time next, the SPT algorithm aims to minimize the average completion time and improve system efficiency.
